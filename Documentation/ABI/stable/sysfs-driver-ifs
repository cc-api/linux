Description:	status of IFS test across all cores. It would show "pass" if all cpus
		passed the test. It would appear "fail", if at least one cpu failed
		the test. It there are no failures, but there is a mix of passed and untested
		cpus, the status will show as "untested".

		The maximum number of retry when the test is not
		executed due to an event such as interrupt. This parameter
		can only be overridden at module load time.
