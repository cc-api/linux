New Features:
=============

PCIe Bandwidth Control (allows throttling PCIe Link Speed)
PCIe Cooling Device per PCIe Root Port

The PCIe Cooling Devices provide userspace interface that can be managed by
thermald (an userspace daemon).

While PCIe Bandwidth Control is targeted for LNL and MTL to help staying
within thermal envelope under some scenarios, the mechanism is generic and
can be used on older platforms as well.
