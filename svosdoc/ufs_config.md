# Universal Flash Storage(UFS)

# Description
When the main storage device (the device that contain the OS) is UFS,
we must make sure the ufshcd driver will be loaded
during boot inorder to take control over the UFS controller and device.
The below configs cause the ufshcd driver to be loaded during the earlyboot phase.
The POR for LNL-M is to use UFS as the main storage device.

# Performance Impacts
